**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the diffusion model. It was interesting to learn about how the model and how it is used to embed watermarks but also as a regeneration attack on watermarks. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I think a potential investigation that would be interesting would be to look into the adversarial watermarking attacks and how to mitigate the effects of the attack. Since adversarial watermarking attacks prevent watermark detection, it would be interesting into delving deeper into a way to prevent this misclassification. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change that I would make is I would have set up our code better at first. We decided to work on a Jupyter notebook, which was great for visualizing and understand what was happening to the images. However, it was a bit disorganized so we are working on fixing that right now. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I want to try bilateral filtering to see its effect on watermark removal.
